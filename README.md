# Vercel and Prisma Client bug reproduction

## Prisma Client isn't generated on deploying to Vercel

The essence of the problem seems to be that Vercel ships a cached version of node_modules with the functions and in some situations the cached node_modules doesn't contain the generated Prisma Client (from the `postinstall` script in Prisma Client or the [`build`](./package.json#L7) script of the actual project). There are certain circumstances that cause this cache to get busted, like updating the `package-lock.json`.

This is a problem when making changes to the Prisma schema. For example, when you add a new field, migrate the database, and update one of your functions to use the new field. When the changes are committed and pushed, Vercel triggers a build that loads the node_modules folder from cache.

Original issue: https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5175

## Reproduction details

In this repo, the following [commit](https://github.com/2color/vercel-prisma-reproduction/commit/4f2194cc1b566dcfba3abe94dc0090fa33432bbd) adds a new field to the Prisma schema and uses it in the `api/feed.js` serverless function. 

Prisma will generate the Prisma Client code to `node_modules` when `prisma generate` is called.

Here's the Vercel build log for the commit:

The problem shows up when the `/api/feed` endpoint the following error is logged:

```

```

This is due to latest generated Prisma Client not being shipped/deployed in the `/api/feed` function.
